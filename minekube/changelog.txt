Context behind this commit is getting Minecraft: Bedrock Edition "Production
Ready".
Bedrock: Added a CM to control the initial server configuration.
Bedrock: Corrected mountPath for world data. (world in java, worlds in bedrock)
Bedrock: Updated the Dockerfile with an entrypoint script to copy a CM to the
expected place.
    * Both versions of Minecraft expect it's config file to be read-write. This
    feature has been disabled for CM's in Kubernetes for a while now according
    to https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/62099
Bedrock: Renamed files to distinguish between Bedrock and Java editions
Bedrock: Added volumeMounts for all paths Minecraft writes significant data to
    * Defaults to emptyDirs
Bedrock: Added sample code for deployment on DigitalOcean's Kubernetes offering
    * PVC, StorageClass
Bedrock: Removed the ipv6 NodePort, but kept the port exposed on the container
    * Doubt that'll be useful today, but a copy of the ipv4 service is trivial
Bedrock: Added way too many comments in the deployment
